The application will have features like adding, updating, and deleting tasks. We will use RESTful API endpoints to communicate between the backend and frontend.

***Setting up the Environment:***
To get started with building the Full-stack Task Manager App, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

You can download Node.js from the official website at https://nodejs.org, and npm will be installed automatically with Node.js.

You will also need to install MongoDB. Download and install the latest version of MongoDB from the official website here. Alternatively, you can also use a cloud-based MongoDB service like MongoDB Atlas.

Install Typescript. If you don't have Typescript already install, you can run the following command to install it globally on your system.

npm install -g typescript

Initialize the project by opening the terminal and create a new directory for the project. Name it task-manager.
Navigate to the directory and run the following command to initialize the project:
npm init -y

This will create a package.json file that will store the project configuration.
